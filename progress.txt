## Codebase Patterns
- Server migration scripts located in migration-scripts/ directory
- Use full-server-backup.sh for complete backup (not just OpenClaw)
- Backup directory: /root/server-backups/
- Current server: 187.77.1.7 (VPS ID: 1343427)
- Migration scripts already tested and working
- All scripts are executable and in migration-scripts/

## Migration Context
- Current installation: OpenClaw + shared folders + Git repos
- Total size: ~834M
- Key components: /docker/openclaw-r8v9, /shared/projects, /shared/scripts
- Security items: SSH keys, API keys, firewall configs
- Backup encryption password: CHANGE_THIS_PASSWORD (default)
