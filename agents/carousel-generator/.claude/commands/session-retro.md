> Create a comprehensive session retrospective covering everything learned today

Create a detailed retrospective document titled `SESSION_RETROSPECTIVE_[DATE].md` that includes:

## Structure Required

1. **Executive Summary**
   - What we built today (high-level overview)
   - Key systems/features completed

2. **Major Learnings**
   - 3-5 key discoveries with deep analysis
   - Include what we tried, what worked, what didn't
   - Add data/metrics where applicable

3. **Things That Worked Well**
   - Patterns and approaches that succeeded
   - Why they worked
   - How to replicate them

4. **Things That Didn't Work**
   - Mistakes made
   - Why they failed
   - How to avoid them next time

5. **What We Got Stuck On**
   - Problems encountered (with time estimates)
   - How we solved them
   - What we should have done differently

6. **What We Should Do Better Next Time**
   - Concrete, actionable improvements
   - Code examples where applicable
   - Priority levels (high/medium/low)

7. **Key Patterns That Worked**
   - Reusable approaches/mental models
   - Real examples from today's session

8. **Metrics and Results**
   - Quantitative analysis of what we built
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Success metrics

9. **Technical Debt Created**
   - What needs fixing later
   - Priority levels
   - Estimated effort

10. **What's Working vs What's Not**
    - ✅ Working well
    - ⚠️ Needs improvement
    - ❌ Not working (known issues)

11. **Time Breakdown**
    - How we spent the session (table format)
    - Time well spent vs time could've saved

12. **Lessons for Next Project**
    - 5-7 concrete takeaways
    - Principles to apply universally

13. **What's Next**
    - Immediate priorities (this week)
    - Short-term (next 2 weeks)
    - Long-term (next month)

14. **Personal Reflections**
    - What went well
    - What was frustrating
    - What surprised us

15. **Final Takeaways**
    - Top 3 lessons
    - Top 3 tools/patterns to reuse
    - Top 3 things to avoid

16. **Appendix**
    - List of all files created/modified today
    - Commands run
    - Links to relevant documentation

## Formatting Requirements

- Use markdown with clear headers
- Include code examples in fenced code blocks
- Use tables for metrics and comparisons
- Use emoji indicators: ✅ ❌ ⚠️ 🔍 🪤 🎯
- Include time estimates where relevant
- Add "Why" explanations for all recommendations

## Tone

- Honest and reflective (acknowledge mistakes)
- Educational (teach future us)
- Action-oriented (concrete next steps)
- Data-driven (use metrics, not just feelings)

## Length

Aim for 1500-2500 words minimum. Be thorough - this is a learning document.

## Output Location

Save to: `SESSION_RETROSPECTIVE_YYYY-MM-DD.md` in the project root.
