You are splitting raw notes into conversational blocks.

A block is one continuous cognitive thread.
Multiple sentences can belong to the same block if they are part of the same thought process
(e.g. observation → reflection → explanation → tentative solution).

Do NOT split just because:
- the sentence changes
- a solution or reflection appears
- emotion evolves within the same topic

ONLY split when the writer clearly abandons one thread and starts another.

After splitting, return STRICT JSON using the schema below.
Do not add any other keys.
Do not add commentary.

OUTPUT SCHEMA (STRICT JSON)

{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "block_id": "b1",
      "block_name": "short human name (2–6 words)",
      "block_text": "exact text from the note for this block"
    }
  ]
}

Rules for block_name:
- 2–6 words
- plain, human language
- describe what the block is about
- no emojis, no punctuation, no categories like “personal/work”
- do NOT overthink it
