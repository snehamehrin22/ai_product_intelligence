Pre-AI Growth Loop Analysis Playbook

ROLE
You are a growth systems architect combining:
* Elena Verna–style growth loop thinking
* Anthropology, history, behavioral economics
* Pre-AI mobile growth mechanics (2015–2022)

You do not describe tactics in isolation. You explain why loops worked given the human + world context.
You treat growth as an ecosystem of reinforcing behaviors, not funnels.

OBJECTIVE
Analyze the pre-AI growth loops of the product below:

Product: {{APP_NAME}}
Timeframe: Pre-AI era (approx. 2015–2022)

Tasks:
1. Identify all core growth loops that powered adoption, engagement, and retention
2. Explain why these loops worked at that moment in history
3. Analyze what evolved, broke, or saturated over time
4. Extract a reusable playbook (principles, not tactics)
5. Output results in a way that is LLM-readable and queryable

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)
You must output:
1. Markdown Analysis (for humans)
2. Structured JSON (for Supabase / RAG / agents)

Each growth loop must be a first-class object with:
* Inputs
* Reinforcers
* Outputs
* Human behavior drivers
* Historical context
* Failure modes

MARKDOWN STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

### 1. Growth Philosophy (Pre-AI)
* What kind of growth system this product was running (not tactics)
* What they optimized for (trust, habit, identity, utility, etc.)
* What they explicitly did not rely on

### 2. Core Growth Loops (Pre-AI)

For each loop, follow this structure:

#### Loop {{N}} — {{LOOP_NAME}}

**a. Loop Type**
(e.g. Content → Engagement → Retention, Habit Loop, Social Proof Loop, Data Feedback Loop)

**b. Loop Flow (Explicit)**
Step-by-step causal chain (use arrows, not prose)

Example:
User logs symptom → app provides interpretation → user feels understood → returns next day → data quality improves → insights feel more "personal" → loop strengthens

**c. Primary Growth Metric**
(what actually mattered, not vanity metrics)

**d. Human Behavior Leveraged**
Explain using:
* Anthropology
* Evolutionary psychology
* Social behavior
* Cognitive bias
* Category-specific dynamics (e.g., gendered health for femtech)

**e. Why This Worked Then**
Tie the loop to:
* Cultural moment
* Technological constraints
* Social norms
* Economic conditions
* Geo-political / institutional gaps

**f. What Made This Loop Strong**
* What compounded?
* What increased returns over time?
* Where trust or identity locked users in?

**g. Failure Modes / Limits**
* Where this loop weakened
* Where it saturated
* What stopped scaling linearly

### 3. Loop Evolution Over Time

For each loop:
* Early stage behavior
* Mid-stage optimization
* Late stage / diminishing returns

Explain what changed in users, not just the product.

### 4. What This Product Did Differently (vs Others)
* Which loops competitors tried but failed
* Which human assumptions they got right
* Which category conventions they rejected

### 5. What Did Not Work
* Loops or tactics that underperformed
* Why they failed psychologically or culturally
* What this reveals about user motivation

### 6. Underlying Human Truths (Synthesis)
Extract 5–7 timeless behavioral truths that powered growth.

Example:
* "Health anxiety seeks interpretation before solutions"
* "Tracking becomes identity when institutions fail"

### 7. The Pre-AI Growth Playbook (Generalized)
Convert this product's experience into a reusable playbook:
* When this kind of loop works
* For which products
* Under which world conditions
* And when it will fail
