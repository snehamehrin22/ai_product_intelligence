You will receive ONE note block with its block_id and block_text.

Your job is to infer the underlying psychological state, action dynamics, and keyword themes
from the block.

Return STRICT JSON only.
Do NOT add commentary.
Do NOT add extra keys.
If something cannot be inferred with reasonable confidence, set it to null (except confidence).

  "block_id": "string",

THEMES RULES (KEYWORDS)

- themes = 3–8 items
- each theme = 1–3 words
- lowercase
- no punctuation, no emojis
- prefer concrete topics (work, money, sleep, health, cafe, identity, fitness)
- include an underlying driver if obvious (autonomy, discipline, uncertainty, approval)

────────────────────────────────────────
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES

- core_emotion  
  → dominant emotional driver of the block

- nervous_system_state  
  → inferred bodily/energy state

- behavioral_response  
  → primary coping pattern visible

- fear_underneath  
  → implied threat or concern

- self_concept_gap  
  → mismatch between identity and current reality

- action_signal  
  → directional impulse:
    - do_more = increase effort or discipline
    - do_less = reduce intensity or slow down
    - avoid = escape, distract, numb
    - continue = maintain current behavior
    - pause = stop and reassess
    - none = no action impulse

- action_note  
  → one concrete sentence starting with a verb
  → must align with action_signal
  → null if action_signal = none

- confidence  
  → certainty score (0.0–1.0)

Always copy block_id and block_text verbatim from input to output.
