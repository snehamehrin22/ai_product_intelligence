# {APP_NAME} — Reddit Behavioral Intelligence Memo

## 0. Metadata & Data Integrity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| App Name | {APP_NAME} |
| Analysis Date | {ANALYSIS_DATE} |
| Data Source | Reddit |
| Total Posts | {TOTAL_POSTS} |
| Total Comments | {{calculate from data}} |
| Time Range Covered | {DATE_START} → {DATE_END} |
| Subreddits Sampled | {SUBREDDITS} |
| Confidence Level | High / Medium / Low |
| Known Biases | {{describe}} |

## 1. Sentiment Distribution (Current Snapshot)

| Sentiment | % of Mentions | Dominant Emotions | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Positive | {{%}} | {{emotions}} | {{summary}} |
| Neutral | {{%}} | {{emotions}} | {{summary}} |
| Negative | {{%}} | {{emotions}} | {{summary}} |
| Mixed | {{%}} | {{emotions}} | {{summary}} |

**Representative Quotes:**
* Positive: "{{quote}}"
* Negative: "{{quote}}"
* Mixed: "{{quote}}"

## 2. Sentiment Shift Over Time (Change Analysis)

### 2.1 Temporal Breakdown

| Period | Dominant Sentiment | What Changed | Evidence |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| Early | {{sentiment}} | {{shift driver}} | {{quote}} |
| Mid | {{sentiment}} | {{shift driver}} | {{quote}} |
| Recent | {{sentiment}} | {{shift driver}} | {{quote}} |

### 2.2 Direction & Shape of Change

* Overall trajectory: Improving / Decaying / Polarizing / Stable
* Negative sentiment becoming: louder? more specific? more emotional?
* Positive sentiment becoming: quieter? more defensive? more instrumental?

## 3. Core Discussion Themes

### 3.1 Stable Themes (Persistent Over Time)

**Theme — {{Theme Name}}**
* What users consistently say
* Underlying need
* Why it matters behaviorally
* Evidence

### 3.2 Emerging Themes (New or Accelerating)

**Theme — {{Theme Name}}**
* When it appears
* What triggered it
* Why it matters now
* Early evidence

⚠️ Treat these as weak signals — do not overstate, do not ignore.

## 4. User Jobs-to-Be-Done (Inferred)

| Job | Evidence | Stability |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| {{job}} | {{quote/paraphrase}} | Stable / Eroding / Emerging |

## 5. Competitive & Substitute Landscape (Dynamic)

### 5.1 Direct Competitors Mentioned

| Competitor | Why Users Mention It | Perceived Advantage |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| {{name}} | {{reason}} | {{advantage}} |

### 5.2 Indirect Substitutes & Displacement

| Substitute | When It Appears | Job It Replaces | Why Users Switch |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| {{name}} | {{period}} | {{job}} | {{reason}} |

## 6. Multi-Lens Interpretation (MANDATORY)

### 6.1 Psychological Lens
* Core emotional drivers

* Authority respected vs rejected
* Signals of overreach, infantilization, or loss of credibility

### 6.7 Emergent Lens (Model-Discovered)
* Name a new lens if data suggests one
* Define it clearly
* Explain why it better explains observed behavior

### 7.1 Identified Loops

| Loop | Trigger | Reward | Evidence | Trend |
|------|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| {{loop}} | {{trigger}} | {{reward}} | {{quote}} | Strengthening / Weakening |
