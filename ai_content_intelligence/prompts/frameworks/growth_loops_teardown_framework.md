# Growth Loops Teardown Framework

Use this framework to analyze how a product grows and how AI is changing those growth mechanics.

## Context

You are analyzing products through the lens of: **"Growth Loops Are Changing"**

**Core thesis:** AI isn't just changing products. It's changing *how products grow.* The growth loops that built the last generation of companies are either accelerating, breaking, or being replaced by something new.

**The 5 Key Behavioral Shifts:**
1. **Visible output change is the new viral loop** — Pre-AI, products grew through shares, invites, network effects. Post-AI, strongest growth comes from *other people noticing that a user got faster, better, or more capable*.
2. **AI that reduces friction compounds. AI that adds capability often doesn't.** — Products using AI to make core action *faster* see immediate behavior change. Products adding AI capabilities on top of complexity often don't.
3. **The retention loop is fragmenting** — Users have AI everywhere now. They learn faster, self-teach sooner, outgrow products quicker. "More data = more value over time" breaks when users get same insight from general AI.
4. **AI features ≠ AI growth loops** — Adding AI improves experience for existing users. But doesn't automatically create acquisition. AI *growth loop* requires visible output change non-users can see, feel, or envy.
5. **Layer > destination** — Products that embed into existing workflows (layers) grow differently from products trying to be the destination. AI accelerates this split.

## Analysis Structure

### Part 1: Primary Growth Loops

For this product, identify 3-4 main growth loops. For each loop, answer:

**Loop Name:** [Give it a descriptive name]

**Loop Type:**
- Virality (user invites user)
- Content-led (content attracts users)
- Paid acquisition (advertising/marketing)
- Network effects (product gets better with more users)
- Platform/API (distribution through integrations)
- Founder-led (founder's audience drives growth)
- Output visibility (users' results market product)

**How it works:**
1. **Trigger:** What starts the loop?
2. **User action:** What does the user do?
3. **Output created:** What gets produced/visible?
4. **Distribution:** How does output reach non-users?
5. **Conversion:** What makes non-user become user?

**Does it compound?** Yes/No
- If yes, how? (Each cycle makes next cycle bigger/faster/easier)
- If no, why not? (Linear, capped, decaying)

**AI Impact Classification:**
- **Pre-AI loop** — Worked before AI, still works, AI doesn't change it
- **AI-enhanced loop** — Existed before AI, but AI makes it faster/stronger
- **AI-native loop** — Didn't exist before AI, only possible because of AI
- **AI-broken loop** — Used to work, AI undermines or fragments it

**Evidence:** What data/signals suggest this loop is active? (User behavior, growth metrics, observable patterns)

### Part 2: Map to Behavioral Shifts

For each of the 5 shifts, assess relevance to this product:

#### Shift #1: Visible Output Change
- **Relevance:** High / Medium / Low / None
- **Evidence:** Do users become visibly faster/better/more capable?
- **Mechanism:** What specific AI capability creates the visible delta?
- **Growth impact:** Does this drive acquisition from non-users noticing?

#### Shift #2: Friction Reduction vs Capability Addition
- **Relevance:** High / Medium / Low / None
- **What AI does:** Reduces friction on existing action OR adds new capability?
- **Behavioral change:** Immediate adoption OR requires learning new workflow?
- **Retention impact:** Does daily behavior actually change?

#### Shift #3: Retention Fragmenting
- **Relevance:** High / Medium / Low / None
- **Retention mechanism:** What keeps users coming back?
- **AI threat:** Can general AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) replace this?
- **Switching cost:** What prevents users from leaving?

#### Shift #4: AI Features vs AI Growth Loops
- **Relevance:** High / Medium / Low / None
- **Assessment:** Does product have AI *features* or AI *growth loops*?
- **Test:** Can non-users see/feel the AI impact before signing up?
- **Gap:** If feature-only, what would turn it into growth loop?

#### Shift #5: Layer vs Destination
- **Relevance:** High / Medium / Low / None
- **Positioning:** Layer (embeds in workflow) OR Destination (separate app/tab)?
- **Distribution advantage:** How does positioning affect discovery?
- **Retention advantage:** How does positioning affect stickiness?

### Part 3: Loop Interaction Map

**How loops feed each other:**
- Loop A creates input for Loop B
- Example: Founder tweets (Loop A) → Users try product → Users ship faster (visible output) → Non-users notice (Loop B)

**How loops compete:**
- Loop A cannibalizes Loop B
- Example: Paid acquisition brings low-intent users who don't create viral output

**Gaps identified:**
Where loops *should* exist but don't:
- Missing social/community loop?
- Missing content-led loop?
- Missing platform distribution?
- Missing visible output from power users?

### Part 4: What This Tells Us About AI and Growth

**Core insight:** [One sentence: What does this product reveal about how AI changes growth?]

**Portable pattern:** [Can other products use this growth mechanic? In which categories?]

**What's working:** [Which loop is strongest? Why?]

**What's at risk:** [Which loop might break as AI commoditizes capabilities?]

**What's missing:** [What growth opportunity isn't being leveraged?]

### Part 5: Carousel Angles

Based on this analysis, suggest 2-3 potential carousel angles:

**Angle 1:**
- Hook concept: [One sentence that stops scroll]
- Core argument: [What you're proving about AI + growth]
- Shifts highlighted: [Which of the 5 shifts]
- Why it matters: [Why builders should care]

**Angle 2:**
[Repeat structure]

**Angle 3:**
[Repeat structure]

## Output Requirements

Your analysis should be:
- **Specific:** Use product details, not generic observations
- **Evidence-based:** Point to actual user behavior, growth signals, product mechanics
- **Behaviorally grounded:** Focus on what people *do*, not what product *claims*
- **Insight-driven:** Show what this reveals about the broader AI + growth thesis
- **Carousel-ready:** Insights should be concrete enough to turn into slides

**Avoid:**
- Generic growth advice ("they should do more marketing")
- Speculation without evidence ("probably uses influencers")
- Feature lists without behavioral impact
- Jargon without explanation
