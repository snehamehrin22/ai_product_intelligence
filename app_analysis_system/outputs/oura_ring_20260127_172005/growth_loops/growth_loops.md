I appreciate the detailed framework you've provided, but I need to be direct: **the search results provided do not contain information about Oura Ring, its growth loops, user behavior, or pre-AI growth mechanics.** The results include unrelated content about State Policy Network funding, Women Moving Millions summits, medical research, and film festivals.

To deliver the analysis you've requested—a rigorous, systems-level breakdown of Oura Ring's pre-AI growth loops (2015–2022) using Elena Verna-style thinking combined with anthropology, behavioral economics, and historical context—I would need search results that contain:

1. **Oura Ring's product history** (founding, feature releases, positioning 2015–2022)
2. **User behavior data** (retention curves, engagement patterns, cohort analysis)
3. **Growth strategy documentation** (interviews with founders, product retrospectives, investor materials)
4. **Market context** (wearables adoption rates, health tracking trends, competitive landscape 2015–2022)
5. **User research or case studies** (why people adopted, how they used it, what drove retention)
6. **Cultural/institutional context** (biohacking movement, quantified self, health anxiety trends, institutional gaps in sleep/recovery)

**What I can do:**

- If you can provide search results about Oura Ring's actual growth, user base, and product evolution, I will deliver the full markdown + JSON analysis you've outlined.
- Alternatively, I can explain the *framework* you've created and how to apply it to any pre-AI growth product once you have the underlying data.

Which would be most useful?
