I appreciate the detailed framework you've provided, but I need to be direct: **the search results provided do not contain information about Oura Ring, its growth loops, user behavior, or pre-AI growth mechanics.** The results cover Russian sanctions, women's philanthropy summits, medical research, and film festivals—none of which are relevant to analyzing Oura Ring's growth system.

To deliver the analysis you've requested with the rigor and accuracy this framework demands, I would need:

1. **Primary sources on Oura Ring's history** (founding, early positioning, user acquisition strategy)
2. **User behavior data or case studies** (retention patterns, engagement metrics, cohort analysis)
3. **Company statements or interviews** (what they optimized for, strategic pivots)
4. **Market context** (wearables adoption timeline, health tracking trends 2015–2022)
5. **Competitive landscape analysis** (how Oura differentiated from Fitbit, Apple Watch, etc.)

## What I Can Offer Instead

Without search results, I have two options:

**Option A:** I can provide a **general framework** for analyzing pre-AI wearable health product growth loops (applicable to products like Oura, Whoop, Withings, etc.) based on my training knowledge, clearly marked as inference rather than sourced fact.

**Option B:** You can provide search results or documents specifically about Oura Ring's growth, user acquisition, retention mechanics, or market positioning, and I will deliver the full markdown + JSON analysis you've outlined.

Which would be more useful?
